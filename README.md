## Platform
Google Collab

## Language
Python

## Libraries
Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Nltk, Seaborn

## Description / Goals 
Our goal is to develop a sentiment classifier using Logistic Regression for a Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset.
1. We experiment with tf-idf word embeddings and we present the best parametres after experementation for both TfidfVectorizer and LogisticRegression Classifier.
2. We use the Classifier to make a prediction on the test set and we check its efficiency with the basic score metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
3. We check for overfitting / underfitting by applying a Stratified 10-fold Cross Validation on the training set.

## Tips
Add the 'articles.tsv' dataset in your 'gdrive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/' path to execute correctly
